# Java Projects Repository

Welcome to my Java Projects repository. This collection showcases simple projects I've worked on as I build experience with Java.

## Projects

1. **Higher or Lower Game**
   - A simple console-based number guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.
   - Features user-friendly prompts and feedback on guesses.
   - Includes a limited number of attempts (7) to make the game challenging.

2. **Calculator Program**
   - Supports the following operators:
     - Addition (`+`)
     - Subtraction (`-`)
     - Multiplication (`*`)
     - Division (`/`)
     - Modulus (`%`)
   - User-friendly prompts for inputting numbers and selecting operators.
   - Handles division by zero with an error message.
   - Validates user inputs for both numbers and operators to ensure a smooth experience.
   - Continues to prompt the user for calculations until they choose to exit the program.

3. **Temperature Tool**
   - A simple application that allows users to input daily temperatures for a week.
   - Calculates and displays:
     - Weekly average temperature.
     - Maximum temperature for the week.
     - Minimum temperature for the week.
     - Whether the average temperature is suitable for a walk (between 15°C and 30°C).
   - User-friendly interface with clear prompts for input.
   - Allows users to repeat tool usage for multiple queries, enhancing usability.
