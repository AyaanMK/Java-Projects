# Java Projects Repository

Welcome to my Java Projects repository. This collection showcases simple projects I've worked on as I build experience with the Java programming language.

## Projects

Here is a list of the Java projects included in this repository:

1. **Higher or Lower Game**
   - A simple console-based number guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.
   - Features user-friendly prompts and feedback on guesses.
   - Includes a limited number of attempts (7) to make the game challenging.

2. **Calculator Program**
   - Supports the following operators:
     - Addition (`+`)
     - Subtraction (`-`)
     - Multiplication (`*`)
     - Division (`/`)
     - Modulus (`%`)
   - User-friendly prompts for inputting numbers and selecting operators.
   - Handles division by zero with an error message.
   - Validates user inputs for both numbers and operators to ensure a smooth experience.
   - Continues to prompt the user for calculations until they choose to exit the program.
