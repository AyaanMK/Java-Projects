# Java Projects Repository

Welcome to my Java Projects repository. This collection showcases simple projects I've worked on as I build experience with Java.

## Projects

1. **Higher or Lower Game**
   - A simple console-based number guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.
   - Features user-friendly prompts and feedback on guesses.
   - Includes a limited number of attempts (7) to make the game challenging.

2. **Calculator Program**
   - Supports the following operators:
     - Addition (`+`)
     - Subtraction (`-`)
     - Multiplication (`*`)
     - Division (`/`)
     - Modulus (`%`)
   - User-friendly prompts for inputting numbers and selecting operators.
   - Handles division by zero with an error message.
   - Validates user inputs for both numbers and operators to ensure a smooth experience.
   - Continues to prompt the user for calculations until they choose to exit the program.

3. **Temperature Tool**
   - A simple application that allows users to input daily temperatures for a week.
   - Calculates and displays:
     - Weekly average temperature.
     - Maximum temperature for the week.
     - Minimum temperature for the week.
     - Whether the average temperature is suitable for a walk (between 15°C and 30°C).
   - User-friendly interface with clear prompts for input.
   - Allows users to repeat tool usage for multiple queries, enhancing usability.

4. **Free Fall Calculator**
   - A console-based application that calculates various kinematic parameters related to free fall.
   - Allows users to select what they would like to calculate from the following options:
     - **Displacement**
     - **Time**
     - **Final Velocity**
     - **Initial Velocity**
     - **Acceleration**
   - Provides detailed prompts for input, ensuring ease of use.
   - Each calculation is backed by relevant physics formulas, making it an educational tool as well as a practical application.
   - Total of 15 formulas
     - 5 variables (displacement, time, final velocity, initial velocity, acceleration)
     - 3 formulas for each variable (due to unknowns)
     - 5 * 3 = 15 possible formulas

5. **Banking System**
   - A console-based banking application that simulates basic banking operations.
   - Features options for:
     - Checking balance
     - Depositing money
     - Withdrawing money
     - Viewing transaction history
     - Exiting the program
   - Maintains a transaction history (up to 100 transactions) and updates the bank balance accordingly.
   - User-friendly prompts for input and validation of transactions to ensure a smooth experience.
   - Displays transaction history in chronological order, providing users with a clear overview of their banking activity.

6. **Slot Machine Game**
   - A console-based game where players engage in a virtual slot machine experience.
   - Players can choose from various actions:
     - **Beg for money**: Players can beg for money, receiving a random amount.
     - **Play Slot Machine**: Players bet money on a slot machine with a chance to win back their bet or hit a jackpot.
     - **Deposit Money**: Allows players to deposit money into their bank account.
     - **Withdraw Money**: Allows players to withdraw money from their bank account.
     - **Exit**: Players can exit the game.
   - The game features a quota system where players must pay $3 every 7 days to continue playing.
   - Includes user-friendly prompts for actions and clear feedback on game outcomes.
