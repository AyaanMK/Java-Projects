# Java Projects Repository

Welcome to my Java Projects repository. This collection showcases simple projects I've worked on as I dive into Java programming. As a high school student with 1 month of Java experience and 4 months of Python coding under my belt, I'm excited to learn and grow in my coding journey.

## About Me

I am a high school student currently exploring Java programming. I started coding in Python for 4 months, which has given me a solid foundation in programming concepts. Now, I continue to expand my skills in Java and create interesting projects to help me learn and further advance into the programming world.

## Projects

Here is a list of the Java projects included in this repository:

1. **Higher or Lower Game**
   - A simple console-based number guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.
   - Features user-friendly prompts and feedback on guesses.
   - Includes a limited number of attempts (7) to make the game challenging.
